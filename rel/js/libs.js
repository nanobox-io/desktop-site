// to call noConflict to hide this version of jQuery, it will work.

// Note that for maximum portability, libraries that are not jQuery should
// declare themselves as anonymous modules, and avoid setting a global if an

      - Pre-Queueing: Prepare the element for animation by instantiating its data cache and processing the call's options.
      - Queueing: The logic that runs once the call has reached its point of execution in the element's $.queue() stack.
                  Most logic is placed here to avoid risking it becoming stale (if the element's properties have changed).
      - Pushing: Consolidation of the tween data followed by its push onto the global in-progress calls container.
    - tick(): The single requestAnimationFrame loop responsible for tweening all in-progress calls.
    - completeCall(): Handles the cleanup process for each Velocity call.
